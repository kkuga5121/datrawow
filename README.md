# DataWoW Assignment in Full-stack developer (Next.js - NestJS)

This repository contains a Next.js and NestJS application for Board Application. This document provides instructions on how to set up and run the application locally.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 12.22.0 or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Installation Front-End Next.JS

Follow these steps to install the application:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd board/front-end-nestjs
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   You can use either npm or Yarn. Choose one of the following commands:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Installation Back-End Next.JS

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   ```bash
   cd board/back-end-nestjs
   ```

2. **Install the dependencies**:

   You can use either npm or Yarn. Choose one of the following commands:

   Using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   Using Yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

3. **Set up your PostgreSQL database**:

   - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
   - Update the database connection string in the `.env` file:

     ```env
     DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/DB_NAME?schema=public"
     ```

   Replace `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `DB_NAME` with your PostgreSQL credentials and database name.

4. **Run Prisma migrations**:

   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

   This command will create the necessary tables in your database based on your Prisma schema.

## Running the Application Front-End

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

or 

```bash
yarn dev
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3001`. You can open this URL in your web browser to view the application.


## Running the Application Back-End

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run start
```

or 

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the server at `http://localhost:3000`. You can open this URL in your web browser to view the application.

## API Documentation

This application uses [Swagger](https://swagger.io/) for API documentation. You can access the interactive API documentation by navigating to `http://localhost:3000/apitest` in your web browser after starting the server. This interface allows you to explore the available endpoints, view request and response formats, and test the API directly from the browser.
